What do Grade R teachers do?

Grade R teachers teach Grade R within a prescribed curriculum, according to the relevant Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS) documents. Grade R falls under the Foundational Phase, in which learning content focuses on three subjects, namely Language, Mathematics and Life Skills. The Foundation Phase Language and Life Skills CAPS documents cover Grade R to Grade 3, while there is a separate CAPS document for Grade R Mathematics. Grade R teachers don’t formally teach language, mathematics and life skills, but expose Grade R learners to these fields, through integrated play-based activities. The main tasks of Grade R teachers include the following:

 

Expose learners to language incidentally through planned interactive activities and through play-based learning.
Expose learners to the following mathematics content areas through play-based activities
numbers, operations and relationships;
patterns, functions and algebra;

measurement; and
data handling.

beginning knowledge and personal and social well-being;
creative arts; and
physical education
